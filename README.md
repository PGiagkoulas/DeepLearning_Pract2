# Human Activity Recognition with improved LSTM models
Performance comparison based on [CNNLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4389), [ConvolutionalLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214), [Stacked LSTM]((https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5778), [Residual LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144) on Human Acitivity Dataset [UCI_HAR_Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)

## Environment Requirements 

[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)

### Note that 
 
For StackedLSTM and ResLSTM, the experiments must be executed on One GPU with CUDA support.
